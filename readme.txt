==============================
Dynamic Battery Storage v2.0.1
==============================

A small utility mod for Kerbal Space Program, intended to support my other projects. Effectively required by Near Future Electrical, CryoEngines, KerballAtomics and CryoTanks.

This mod dynamically adjusts ElectricCharge (EC) storage to combat the game's awful handling of resource generation/draw mechanics at high timewarp. It should dramatically reduce instances of bad ship consequences due to EC loss at these times.

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

=======
KSP-AVC
=======

This mod is compatible with KSP-AVC version checking. For a comprehensive version checking experience, please download the appropriate plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
